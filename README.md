Project Title: Basic Text Search Engine with User Feedback Learning

Overview

This project demonstrates the creation of a simple text search engine in Python that improves its results based on user feedback. The search engine uses Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) and scikit-learn to tokenize, stem, and vectorize text documents and queries. It leverages Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (tf-idf) and cosine similarity to rank documents based on relevance to user queries. Additionally, it incorporates user feedback to enhance future search results.

Features

    Tokenization and Stemming: Processes text to remove punctuation and normalize words to their base forms.
    Vector Space Model: Represents documents and queries as vectors using tf-idf.
    Cosine Similarity: Calculates similarity between query and document vectors.
    User Feedback Integration: Adjusts search rankings based on user interaction feedback.

Dependencies

    Python 3.10
    nltk
    scikit-learn
    numpy
